  If you look for my Persian writings please head to my <a href="http://mehdix.ir"> other website</a>.
</p>

I'm an Iranian expat leaving currently in Germany. I'm interested in
science, software, entrepreneurship, minimalism, space, chess and a whole
bunch of other things.

I try to stay focused and move forward step by step while
being mindful and playing the life game the way we play Lego, well defined pieces
stick to each other to form a bigger picture.

If you want to drop me a line <a href="mailto:hi@mehdisadeghi.me">here you are</a>.


Thanks for reading!
